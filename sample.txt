HYDERABAD: It is official. The people of Telangana will soon say goodbye to the 21-year-old Telangana Rashtra Samiti, popularly known as TRS, because the party is all set to lose its name, besides its Telangana-specific identity, and will welcome a national party, the BRS.

While the initials BRS are confirmed, what they stand for is yet to be confirmed as there are three different expansions under active consideration — Bharatiya Rashtra Samiti, Bharat Rashtriya Samiti and Bharat Rashtra Samiti.

Even the party flag would undergo a metamorphosis, with the Telangana map set to be replaced with a map of India to stamp the new national identity and ambition, and help the party create a pan-India appeal for itself.

Party sources said that TRS president and Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao had decided to hold the party’s state executive meeting either on June 21 or 22 to pass a resolution to change the name of TRS to BRS. The move, party sources said, will help create a pan-India appeal for it, and enable it to play a pivotal role in national politics, by offering an “alternative political agenda” to India.
